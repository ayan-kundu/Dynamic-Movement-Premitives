This repo is based on Imitation Learning using Learning from Demonstration(LfD)

Imitation learning:

Learning from Demonstration(LfD):-

Application1:- Pick and place
The graphs I attached is made using pic and place operation. These graphs shows a good amount of imitation learning, the robot is capable of.

In Pick and place I got an idea of Food unloading to dish from microwave where pick pose would be the food inside the microwave and the place pose would be the plate position.

Application2:- Wave gesture
It is able to imitate hand wave trajectory. So if I put a palm structure on it gripper it can wave from any position and it will carry on waving for a certain time irrespective if its initial body pose.

Future aspect: putting vision 
After I sort this gripper issue, it would be ready but I was thinking to put computer vision so that it can automatically pick (no need to give pick position anymore) and place to the given place position.
