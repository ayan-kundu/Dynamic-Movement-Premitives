#### Imitation learning:

**Learning from Demonstration(LfD):-**

***Application1:-*** **Pick and place**
The graphs I attached is made using pic and place operation. These graphs shows a good amount of imitation learning, the robot is capable of.

- [x] In Pick and place I got an idea of Food unloading to dish from microwave where pick pose would be the food inside the microwave and the place pose would be the plate position.

***Application2:-*** **Wave gesture**
It is able to imitate hand wave trajectory. So if I put a palm structure on it gripper it can wave from any position and it will carry on waving for a certain time irrespective if its initial body pose.

- [x] Burn ATOM to its latest version 4.2

> What's Coming next: putting vision in it 
With computer vision(Employing a camera on ATOM) it would automatically pick (no need to give pick position anymore) and place to the given place position.
